# MCP-Deep-Dive-Series

ðŸ“˜ MCP-Deep-Dive-Series

MCP-Deep-Dive-Series is a monthly curated collection of resources dedicated to the Model Context Protocol (MCP) ecosystem. This repository aggregates the latest developments, tutorials, tools, and discussions from various platforms, including GitHub, YouTube, blogs, and community forums, providing a centralized hub for enthusiasts and professionals alike.

ðŸ§  What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard introduced by Anthropic in late 2024. It facilitates seamless communication between AI assistants and external tools or data sources, enabling structured, secure, and extensible interactions. MCP supports various transport protocols like stdio and HTTP with Server-Sent Events (SSE), and it's designed to be model-agnostic, allowing integration across different AI systems.

[Your API is not an MCP | DEMFP786](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeOANluSqAE)

```
A lot of companies have jumped on the MCP bandwagon by quickly auto-generating their MCP servers from their APIs.
This isnâ€™t right as MCP servers are made to be consumed by LLMs and not by humans.
Join us to better understand why MCPs have to be thought of carefully.
Experience examples of tools that make sense for agents but not for humans, and why you
should be careful designing your MCP set of tools and resources.
